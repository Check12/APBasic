APBasic GitHub for the Classic AP User's Group on Linked In

This APBasic source code repository is primarily for the User's Group on linked in, However anyone is welcome to participate and contribute to the library of APBasic scripts. The goal is provide a one stop shopping location for usefull System One, and System Two APBasic scripts.

Most audio designers, test and measurement engienners, etc. are not familiar with software design tools like git. Git was created by Linus Torvolds (Linux) and is used worldwide along with Github to provide a remote collabortive website for source control management. This is my first git hub so I am learning here as well. 

My hope is that this repository will grow along with the Linked In User Group to provide a rich library of open source scripts that can be used with the Classic AP Systems we have all grown to love. 

Happy coding...
